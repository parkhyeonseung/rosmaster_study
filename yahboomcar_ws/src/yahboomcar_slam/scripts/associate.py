"""
The Kinect provides the color and depth images in an un-synchronized way. This means that the set of time stamps from the color images do not intersect with those of the depth images. Therefore, we need some way of associating color images to depth images.

For this purpose, you can use the ''associate.py'' script. It reads the time stamps from the rgb.txt file and the depth.txt file, and joins them by finding the best matches.
